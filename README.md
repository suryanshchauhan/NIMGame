# NIMGame in Python

This project implements the game of NIM in Python. For those who are unfamiliar with NIM, here are the rules of the game:

1) There are two players. The program has one human player (the user) and one computer player, and the computer should always move first.
2) Between the two players is a pile of sticks (or other objects). They start with 15 sticks, but the program should is flexible enough that the number of sticks could be easily changed.
3) The players take turns (the program allows the computer player to start all the time). On each turn, a player may take 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 sticks from the pile in the middle. 
4) The winner of the game is the player that takes the last stick from the pile.

## Specifications:
1) The code prevents the user from selecting an inappropriate number of sticks.
2) The code prevents the computer from selecting an inappropriate number of sticks.
3) The program should is flexible enough that the number of sticks could be easily changed.
4) The program is flexible enough that you could change this rule to allow taking any number of sticks relatively easily.
5) The program tells which player's turn it is, how many sticks were taken, and how many sticks are left in the pile. When a player wins, there is a clear message as to who won.
